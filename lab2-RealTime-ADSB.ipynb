    "Decoding the packets is beyond the scope of this lab, but at a high level, the decoding is done by first identifying the useful packets containing location information. For our lab, we are only interested in long squitters with Downlink Format (DF) = 17, which can be identified by the first 5 bits. Once we have identified a DF-17 packet, we can identify the airplane type (ICAO address) from Bytes 2 to 4. The rest of the packet will contain the altitude, latitude and longitude information, which look like this:\n",

    "\n",
    "The latitude and longitude are tricky to decode as there are not enough bits to encode all locations. Each ADS-B packet is further divided into even and odd packets and there is a  complicated equation to combine one even and one odd packet to get the exact location...\n",
