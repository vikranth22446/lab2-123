    "\n",
    "Pulse position modulation belongs to the family of amplitude-modulated signals and in particular to the class of amplitude-shift-keying (ASK) or on-off-keying (OOK). In OOK, `0`, `1` bits are sent by turning the carrier on and off. PPM uses the [Manchester](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_code) encoding variant of OOK. The idea in Machester encoding is that in each bit interval there is always a transition between on and off and the transition occurs in the middle of the bit interval. For example, a transition from off to on would represent a `0` and a transition from on to off would represent a `1`. Manchester codes have the advantage of being self clocking so the clock can be recovered from the data stream. \n",

    "## Preamble Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to automatically detect packets. Detecting the preamble is a good way to start, as the preamble is the same for all packets. In general, a good detector should have the minimum number of false negatives and false positives. For ADS-B packets, we care more about false negatives, since this means that we may be missing an important packet. At the same time, a false positive would result in a packet which we can not decode, which is not harmful, except that we spend time in extra computation to perform parity checks. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Noise floor estimation\n",
    "When looking at detection, it is useful to know what is the noise level compared to the signal level. This can help setting thresholds for detecting signals. When noise has Gaussian statistics, we can calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation to estimate its distribution. Unfortunately, our received signal is not only contaminated by Gaussian random noise (actually, the magnitude is [Rayleigh distributed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_distribution)  -- not Gaussian, but we will ignore that). It is also contaminated by interference as well as bursts of ADS-B packet data. If we compute the sample mean and standard deviation, they could be biased by strong outliers coming from the packet bursts. \n",
    "\n",
    "One solution is to use robust estimation using median calculations. The median is a measure which is robust to outliers and can be used to estimate the mean. In order to robustly estimate the standard deviation we can use the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) estimator: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_absolute_deviation. The MAD is computed in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mathrm{MAD}(X) = \\mathrm{median}(|X - \\mathrm{median}(X)|) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "As it turns out, the standard deviation can be approximated from the MAD by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma \\approx 1.4826 \\mathrm{MAD} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "While this should work most of the time, I found that the MAD does not work well on the SDR data. The reason is that the SDR has only 8-bit accuracy. This quantization throws off the MAD, and was making me mad as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Iterative estimation with outlier rejection\n",
    "Instead, we will look at an iterative calculation which ignores outliers. The idea is simple: We will compute the mean and standard deviation with the outliers. These will be biased, of course. We will use these biased estimators to calculate a threshold and recompute the mean and standard deviation within the threshold -- thus throwing away the largest outliers. We will repeat a few more times until the result converges.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Compute the mean ``y_mean`` and standard deviation ``y_std`` of the sequence. You will find the functions ``mean`` and ``std`` most useful.\n",

The issue is, that with noise and interference, the \"shape\" of the preamble might differ considerably and will result in low correlation. There are other classifiers which can be made immune to different sources of imperfections. \n",
    "Our received preambles have varying total amplitudes (planes are near and far), have bias, and also exhibit amplitude modulation. At the same time, the preamble is relatively short. Instead of matched filtering, we can devise a non-linear classifier which may be more robust. Here, we will look at detecting the preamble using logic.\n",

If we just consider logic (e.g. comparing highs and lows), we can make our detection significantly more robust to the bias and amplitude modulation. Another benefit of using logic is that it can be computationally more efficient than normalized matched filtering. Because of this, it is more suitable for real-time applications.\n",

For example, in order to avoid detection of noise that resembles the preamble, we can set a minimum limit on the amplitude of highs we consider a detection.
